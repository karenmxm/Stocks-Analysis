# Stocks-Analysis
This study helps investors find the total daily volume and yearly return for multiple stocks. Daily volume is the total number of shares traded throughout the day; it measures how actively a stock is traded. The yearly return is the percentage change in price from the beginning of the year to the end of the year. 

First, we use our code to help Steve, a new Finance gradate, to perform analysis on “Daqo” (DQ), a solar panel firm, for his parents. We found DQ might not be the best option for Steve’s parents to invest in because its returns in 2018 is - 62.60%. Then we analyzed multiple stocks to find some better choices for them.
