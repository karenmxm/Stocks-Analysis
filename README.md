# Stocks-Analysis

This study helps investors find the Total Daily Volume and Yearly Return for multiple stocks. Daily volume is the total number of shares traded throughout the day; it measures how actively a stock is traded. The yearly return is the percentage change in price from the beginning of the year to the end of the year. 

First, we used our code to help Steve, a new Finance gradate, to perform analysis on “Daqo” (DQ), a solar panel firm, for his parents. We found DQ might not be the best option for Steve’s parents to invest in because its returns in 2018 is - 62.60%. Then we analyzed multiple stocks to find some better choices for them. 

# Analysis on Multiple Stocks (Challenge)

We provided an VBA Macro that can analyze all stocks in the market. 

We applied this code to the short list of green energy stocks from Steve's list and found ENPH might be a good choice for his parents. 

ENPH's 2017 return was 129.52% and 2018 returns was 81.92%. The slowing down of returns comes from the market or industry. In 2017, 11 out of 12 stocks' returns were positive. ENPH's return ranked #3 and total volume of traded ranked #5. In 2018, only 2 out of 12 stocks got positive returns. ENPH ranked #2 and total volume traded ranked #1.
